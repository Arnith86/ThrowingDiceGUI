# Project Overview

This project is built upon [ThrowingDice](https://github.com/Arnith86/ThrowingDice) , which I remade to gauge my improvement.
However, I was not satisfied with it being only a console application. In this version, I experiment with implementing a UI using Avalonia.
I also explore different coding approaches, including the MVVM pattern and more advanced techniques.
